# ChatApps

In this repository i build two project, first project is group chat app, second project is a one-on-one chat app.
In both projects i use spring boot and websockets to build a real-time chat app.

WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables bidirectional communication between a cliend and a server over a single TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) socket. HTTP is used for communication between clients and servers, but HTTP is request-response-based, meaning the server cannot send data to the client without a prior client request. WebSocket provides an efficient solution for applications that require fast and updated data exchange in real-time. A persistent connection refers to maintaining an open link between two devices (client and server) over an extended period, rather than closing the connection after each individual request and response.
